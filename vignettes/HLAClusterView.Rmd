# Introduction #

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex plays a primary biological role in 
the regulation of the immune system. It also plays a critical role in the
outcomes of human organ transplantation [@Choo2007]. 

The set of genes that form the HLA complex are highly polymorphic and the 
novel alleles are still discovered [@Abraham2018]. Because of their high 
polymorphic status, accurate typing of HLA genes with short-read sequencing 
data is a challenging task. Software specialized in HLA typing such
as xHLA [@Xie2017] and HLAProfiler [@Buchkovich2017], had to be developped. 

Since 1998, the IMGT/HLA Database [@Robinson2015] has provided curated 
information about polymorphism in the human genes of the immune system.
The naming of HLA genes, allele sequences, and their quality control under the 
responsibility of the [WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System](http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/committee.html).

# Workflow #

The *`r packageDescription("HLAClustRView")[["Package"]]`* package is splitted
in 3 main sections: input, process and visualization. The Figure 1 shows the
workflow within each section.

TODO

# Metrics which estimate similarity between two HLA typing 

To enable quantification of the similarity between two HLA typing, similarity
metric must be used.

## Hamming distance based on first HLA typing field 

TODO

# An analysis step by step #

### 1. Loading the HLAClustRView package

```{r loadingPackage, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} 
library(HLAClustRView)
```

### 2. Parsing HLA typing samples file

The file containing the HLA typing for all analysed samples needs to be loaded.
This task is done by the *prepareHLADataset()* function.

### 3. Calculating similarity metric

The Hamming distance based on first HLA typing field can be calculated through
the *hamming_distance_digit1()* function.
