abstract = {The IMGT/HLA Database has provided a repository for information regarding polymorphism in the genes of the immune system since 1998. In 2003, it was absorbed into the Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD). The IPD project has enabled us to create and maintain a platform for curating and publishing locus-specific databases which are either involved directly with, or relate to, the function of the Major Histocompatibility Complex across a number of species. In collaboration with specialist groups and nomenclature committees individual sections have been curated prior to their submission to the IPD for online publication. The IPD consists of five core databases, with the primary database being the IMGT/HLA Database. With the work of various nomenclature committees, the HLA Informatics Group, and alongside the European Bioinformatics Institute, we provide access to this data through the website ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/ ) to the public domain. The IPD project continually develops new tools in conjunction with on-going scientific developments-such as Next-Generation Sequencing-to maintain efficiency and usability in response to user feedback and requests. The website is updated on a regular basis to ensure that new and confirmatory sequences are distributed to the immunogenetics community, as well as the wider research and clinical communities.},

@article{Buchkovich2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Background: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is a genomic region involved in regulating the human immune system by encoding cell membrane major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins that are responsible for self-recognition. Understanding the variation in this region provides important insights into autoimmune disorders, disease susceptibility, oncological immunotherapy, regenerative medicine, transplant rejection, and toxicogenomics. Traditional approaches to HLA typing are low throughput, target only a few genes, are labor intensive and costly, or require specialized protocols. RNA sequencing promises a relatively inexpensive, high-throughput solution for HLA calling across all genes, with the bonus of complete transcriptome information and widespread availability of historical data. Existing tools have been limited in their ability to accurately and comprehensively call HLA genes from RNA-seq data. Results: We created HLAProfiler ( https://github.com/ExpressionAnalysis/HLAProfiler ), a k-mer profile-based method for HLA calling in RNA-seq data which can identify rare and common HLA alleles with {\textgreater} 99{\%} accuracy at two-field precision in both biological and simulated data. For 68{\%} of novel alleles not present in the reference database, HLAProfiler can correctly identify the two-field precision or exact coding sequence, a significant advance over existing algorithms. Conclusions: HLAProfiler allows for accurate HLA calls in RNA-seq data, reliably expanding the utility of these data in HLA-related research and enabling advances across a broad range of disciplines. Additionally, by using the observed data to identify potential novel alleles and update partial alleles, HLAProfiler will facilitate further improvements to the existing database of reference HLA alleles. HLAProfiler is available at https://expressionanalysis.github.io/HLAProfiler/.},

@article{Choo2007,
abstract = {The human major histocompatibility complex HLA is located on the short arm of chromosome 6. It is known to be the most polymorphic genetic system in humans. The biological role of the HLA class I and class II molecules is to present processed peptide antigens. The HLA system is clinically important as transplantation antigens. Molecular HLA allele typing is routinely performed to provide HLA class I and class II allele matching in unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Prospective lymphocyte crossmatching is critical in solid organ transplantation to prevent allograft rejection. HLA alloimmunization causes various problems in transfusion therapy. The HLA system is associated with certain diseases, but its underlying mechanisms are not yet fully explained.},

@article{Gutierrez-Arcelus2016a,
abstract = {Genome-wide strategies have driven the discovery of more than 300 susceptibility loci for autoimmune diseases. However, for almost all loci, understanding of the mechanisms leading to autoimmunity remains limited, and most variants that are likely to be causal are in non-coding regions of the genome. A critical next step will be to identify the in vivo and ex vivo immunophenotypes that are affected by risk variants. To do this, key cell types and cell states that are implicated in autoimmune diseases will need to be defined. Functional genomic annotations from these cell types and states can then be used to resolve candidate genes and causal variants. Together with longitudinal studies, this approach may yield pivotal insights into how autoimmunity is triggered.},
