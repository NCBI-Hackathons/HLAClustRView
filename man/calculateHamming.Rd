\title{Calculate Hamming distance between all samples}
\usage{
calculateHamming(hla_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{hla_data}{a \code{list} of class \code{HLADataset} containing a
\code{tibble} object with the HLA typing information for all samples. At
least 2 samples must be present be able to calculate the metric.}
}
\value{
a \code{tibble} object containing the Hamming distance values
between each possible pair of samples. TODO
}
\description{
Takes an object containing HLA typing information for all
samples and computes the Hamming distance
for each pair of samples.
}
\details{
The Hamming distance is given by
\eqn{min(s1A1 != s2A1 + s1A2 != s2A2, s1A1 != s2A2 + s1A2 != s2A1)} where
\code{s1} and \code{s2} are two samples and \code{A1} and \code{A2} are
there alleles.
}
\examples{

## Load example dataset
