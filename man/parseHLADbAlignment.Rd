\title{Parse HLA Database alignment files for a specific alignment type}
\usage{
parseHLADbAlignment(hlaDbPath, seqType = c("nuc", "gen", "prot"))
}
\arguments{
\item{hlaDbPath}{A \code{character} string, the path to the directory of
the alignment files from
\url{http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/text_index.html}. The directory must
exist and contain at least one HLA alignment file.}

\item{seqType}{A \code{character} string, the sequence type of the file to
parse. The choices are: "nuc" for CDS sequence, "gen" for genomic, and
"prot" for protein. Default: "nuc".}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{HLAdb} with 3 entries. The entries are:
\itemize{
\item \code{refSeq} A \code{list} of \code{character} string that
represent reference sequences; one sequence
per HLA gene.
\item \code{posInit} A \code{list} of \code{integer};
one starting position per HLA gene.
\item \code{HLAAlignment} A \code{data.table} containing the information
for each allele of each HLA gene.
}
}
\description{
Parse HLA Database alignment files that are present in a
directory, as specified by input, an
generate a class object that can be used in further analysis. The function
only parse one type of aligment file at the time. There is 3 types of
alignment files that can be parsed: CDS sequence, genomic and protein.

Beware that the names of the alignment files should not be changed as
the name is used to identify the gene that is currently parsed.

\examples{

## Get path where some HLA database files are stored
directory <- system.file("extdata", package = "HLAClustRView")

## Parse HLA database files of protein type
HLAInfo <- parseHLADbAlignment(hlaDbPath=directory, seqType="prot")

## Show reference sequences
HLAInfo$refSeq
